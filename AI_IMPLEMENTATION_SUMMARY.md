# AI-Driven Cross-Sectional Modification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of AI-driven cross-sectional information modification for structural members (beams and columns) in the 2D structural analysis application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Member Type Detection
- **Column Members (柱部材)**: Identified as members where the X-coordinates of start and end points are the same (vertical members)
- **Beam Members (梁部材)**: Identified as members where the Y-coordinates of start and end points are the same (horizontal members)
- Tolerance: 1e-6 meters for coordinate comparison

### 2. Natural Language Processing
The system can process instructions like:
- "柱部材をH-200×100に変更" (Change column members to H-200x100)
- "梁の断面をH-300x150に変更" (Change beam sections to H-300x150)

### 3. Steel Section Detection
Supports multiple steel section patterns:
- H-shapes: `H-200×100`, `H-250×125×6×9` (with or without thickness)
- Square/Rectangular pipes: `□100×100×6`
- Round pipes: `φ165.2×7.1`
- Channel shapes: `C-100×50×5×7.5`
- Angles: `L-90×90×9`

### 4. Section Name Display Format
All section names are displayed with complete information including thickness:
- H-shapes: "H形鋼（細幅） 250×125×6×9"
- Square pipes: "角形鋼管 100×100×4.5"
- Round pipes: "円形鋼管 φ165.2×7.1"

### 5. 3D Viewer Integration
- Section information is correctly displayed and rendered in the 3D viewer
- Member information display function shows complete section details
- Works for both AI-generated models and manual section selection

## Key Functions

### Core Functions

1. **`identifyMemberType(member, nodes)`**
   - Determines if a member is a column, beam, or other type
   - Returns: 'column' | 'beam' | 'other'

2. **`applySectionChangesToMemberType(targetMemberType, steelData, nodes, members)`**
   - Applies section changes only to specified member type
   - Updates both the HTML table and the 3D viewer

3. **`updateMemberSectionInTable(memberIndex, steelData)`**
   - Updates the member table row with new section properties
   - Generates section name with complete thickness information

4. **`detectAndFetchSteelProperties(prompt)`**
   - Detects steel patterns and member types from user prompts
   - Associates steel sections with member types based on proximity in text

5. **`findSteelPropertiesFromLibrary(steelInfo)`**
   - Searches the steel data library for matching sections
   - Prioritizes `hkatakou_hoso` (narrow-flange H-shapes) for 2-dimension patterns
   - Falls back to `hkatakou_hiro` (wide-flange H-shapes) if needed

6. **`calculateDimensionDistance(targetDims, actualDims, steelType)`**
   - Calculates the distance between target and actual dimensions
   - Handles both 2-dimension (H×B) and 4-dimension (H×B×t1×t2) specifications
   - Returns weighted distance for optimal matching

### Integration Functions

7. **`setMultipleMembersSectionInfoFromAI(steelDataArray, memberTypes)`**
   - Sets section information for multiple members based on detected member types
   - Calls `applySectionChangesToMemberType` for selective updates

8. **`applyGeneratedModel(modelData, mode)`**
   - Preserves existing section information when AI generates models
   - Ensures all detailed section properties are maintained

9. **`integrateEditData(existingModel, aiGeneratedData)`**
   - Merges AI-generated data with existing model data in "edit" mode
   - Preserves all section-related properties from existing members

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Incorrect Section Selection (H-200×100 → 150×150)
**Problem**: When instructing "柱部材をH-200×100に変更", the system was setting "150×150" instead.

**Solution**:
- Modified `getSteelTypeFromPattern` to prioritize `hkatakou_hoso` for 2-dimension H-shapes
- Enhanced `findSteelPropertiesFromLibrary` to explicitly search `hkatakou_hoso` first
- Improved `calculateDimensionDistance` to handle 2-dimension H-shapes correctly

### Fix 2: Default Preset Not Displaying Section Information
**Problem**: Preset 2A-5 didn't display section information on default load, but worked when re-selected.

**Solution**:
- Added `PRESET_SECTION_PROFILES` array with complete section mappings
- Modified `loadPreset` to explicitly set `sectionInfo` for preset 15 (2A-5)
- Moved `setRowSectionInfo` and `applySectionAxisDataset` to global scope
- Added `setTimeout` to ensure 3D viewer updates after section info is set

### Fix 3: Manual Member Addition Losing Section Information
**Problem**: After AI model generation, manually added/modified members lost section information.

**Solution**:
- Modified manual member addition logic to call `window.setRowSectionInfo`
- Created default "estimated" circular section based on area for new members
- Ensured `dataset.sectionInfo` is populated for all manually added members

### Fix 4: All Members Losing Section Information After AI Edit
**Problem**: When using AI to add/modify members, ALL members (including unchanged ones) lost section information.

**Root Causes**:
1. `integrateEditData` wasn't preserving all detailed section properties
2. `applyGeneratedModel` wasn't preserving existing section information
3. `calculateDimensionDistance` was receiving incorrect parameter type

**Solutions**:
1. Modified `integrateEditData` to explicitly copy ALL section-related properties:
   - `sectionInfo`, `sectionInfoEncoded`, `sectionLabel`, `sectionSummary`, `sectionSource`
   - `sectionAxisKey`, `sectionAxisMode`, `sectionAxisLabel`
   - `Zx`, `Zy`, `ix`, `iy`

2. Modified `applyGeneratedModel` to retrieve and assign all section properties from `currentModel.members[index]`

3. Fixed `findSteelPropertiesFromLibrary` to pass `rowDims` object (not array) to `calculateDimensionDistance`

- [x] Section name displays with complete thickness information
- [x] 3D viewer renders section information correctly
- [x] Member information display shows complete section details
- [x] Default preset (2A-5) displays section information correctly
- [x] AI model generation preserves existing section information
- [x] Manual member addition sets default section information
- [x] Edit mode preserves section information for unchanged members
- [x] Selective section changes (only columns or only beams) work correctly

## Known Limitations

1. The system assumes column members are perfectly vertical and beam members are perfectly horizontal
2. Tolerance for coordinate comparison is fixed at 1e-6 meters (0.001 mm)
3. For members that are neither vertical nor horizontal, the system classifies them as 'other' and may not apply section changes

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for diagonal members (斜材) with angle-based detection
2. More flexible tolerance settings for coordinate comparison
3. Support for more complex steel section types
4. Batch editing of multiple member types in a single instruction
5. Undo/redo functionality for section changes

## Files Modified

- `frame_analyzer.js`: Core logic for AI generation, steel detection, and section management
- `viewer_3d.js`: 3D visualization with section name display
- `steel_selector.js`: Manual section selection with thickness information

## Conclusion

The AI-driven cross-sectional modification feature is now fully implemented and working correctly. All reported issues have been addressed, and the system can:

1. Correctly identify column and beam members
2. Detect steel sections from natural language instructions
3. Apply section changes selectively to specified member types
4. Display complete section information including thickness
5. Preserve section information during AI model generation and editing
6. Render section information correctly in the 3D viewer

The implementation follows best practices for data preservation and ensures that existing section information is never lost during model modifications.
